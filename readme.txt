# A simple script to automate automating material asset creation and thumbnailing in Blender 3.0
# DIRECTIONS:

1. In Blender, append materials to "assetAutomatorTemplate.blend"

2. Run "assetAutomator.py" NOTE: execution with a dozen or more appended materials may take a while.

3. Mark materials you want to keep as assets

4. (OPTIONAL): Move the "cameraSet" group along X and Y in units of 2 to render and save thumbnails of your renderball materials.

5. Save the Blender file with an appropriate name (e.g. "metals.blend")

6. In Blender 3.0 Preferences, point to the saved file under Asset Libraries
